# MAPLE Nowcasting

This repository contains a Flutter app for Android and iOS that facilitates access to [nowcasting data](https://radar.mcgill.ca/imagery/nowcasting.html) provided by [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca/)'s J.S. Marshall Radar Observatory.

## What is Nowcasting

Put simply, [nowcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowcasting_(meteorology)) is a practice which aims to accurately extrapolate future data using past trends. In meteorology, nowcasting is primarily used to predict rainfall in the near future (up to 2-6 hours in advance). McGill's MAPLE algorithm predicts precipitation in the near future by extrapolation from recent radar composite imagery, and this data is generously calculated and provided online by the university for central Canada and the US northeast, updated every 10 minutes.
